This is my submission for the second year semester project for the [Noroff Frontend Development course](https://www.noroff.no/en/studies/vocational-school/front-end-development).

## Description

### Project Brief

The brief for this project was to create an auction house website.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site.
They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. 
Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

### Technology stack

- HTML & Javascript
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool and development server
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) & [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) plugins for styling

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/joakimtveter/noroff-semester-project-2.git`
2. Run `npm install` from inside the project folder to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

### Deployment

The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Any commit to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment.
The site can be found at [https://sp2.tveter.dev](https://sp2.tveter.dev).

### Contributing

This is a school project, so I will not be accepting any contributions.
